# Text4Quiz ForgeFlow Development Notes

## CEO Context Input
**Date**: September 3, 2025

### Key Requirements from Discovery
- **Question Generation**: Works well but auto-triggers unnecessarily during delivery
- **Main Pain Point**: 15-minute batch delivery instead of precision timing
- **Delivery Philosophy**: Sharp timing, single attempts, no retries
- **Success Metrics**: Daily stats + proactive issue detection for excellent user experience
- **Quality Focus**: "I really want it to work well for our users"

## Current System Analysis (Sept 3, 2025)

### Working Components âœ…
- Database architecture (PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM)
- Admin dashboard with comprehensive monitoring
- Question bank (large, well-categorized)
- Circuit breaker pattern (just auto-reset after timeout)
- User management with phone validation

### Critical Blockers ðŸš¨
1. **Database Connection Failure**: Preventing delivery queue processing
2. **Twilio Authentication Error**: "SMS error: Authenticate" since Aug 27
3. **Code Errors**: 4 LSP diagnostics in routes.ts breaking service functionality
4. **Batch Processing Logic**: 15-min windows vs required precision timing

### Recurring Issue Patterns
- **Authentication Problems**: Twilio credentials failing intermittently
- **Service Recovery**: Manual intervention often required for full restoration
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Good metrics but no proactive alerting
- **Logic Complexity**: Multiple scheduler services causing confusion

## UHW Implementation Tracking

### UHW-S1: SMS Delivery Restoration
**Status**: In Progress (Sept 3, 2025)
**Approach**: Database-First (fix connection issues first)
**Critical Path**:
1. Resolve database connection failures
2. Fix 4 code errors in routes.ts
3. Verify/restore Twilio authentication
4. Test delivery pipeline end-to-end

**Expected Verification Time**: 60-90 minutes
**Success Criteria**: 
- Database connections stable
- No TypeScript errors
- SMS test messages successfully sent
- Delivery queue processing normally

### Architecture Insights
- Queue-based scheduler was correct approach vs timezone matching
- Circuit breaker essential but needs better recovery mechanisms
- Precision timing requirement conflicts with current batch processing design
- Monitoring dashboard valuable, needs alerting layer for proactive detection

### Failed Attempts & Lessons
- Circuit breaker stuck required system restart (now auto-resets after 5 mins)
- Previous scheduler replacement successful but delivery logic still problematic
- Good monitoring exists but reactive not proactive

## Next Priority Focus
1. **Immediate**: Complete UHW-S1 (restore basic SMS delivery)
2. **Short-term**: UHW-007 (precision timing to replace batches)  
3. **Medium-term**: UHW-008 (single-attempt delivery logic)
4. **Enhancement**: Proactive alerting system

## Blind Spots for Future UHWs
- Performance optimization (query performance, response times)
- Scalability (single-threaded delivery processing)
- Data backup/restore procedures
- Automated testing for delivery logic
- Security improvements (session management types)
